# Coding Assignment: Simple Task Manager

## 📋 Overview
Build a simple task management application that demonstrates both your technical skills and leadership thinking.

## 🎯 Goal
Create a **basic task list app** where users can add tasks, mark them as complete, and view their task list.

## ✅ Requirements

### Core Features (Required)
1. **Add Task**: Users can add a new task with a title
2. **Mark Complete**: Users can mark tasks as "Done" 
3. **View Tasks**: Display the list of all tasks with their status

### Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: Next.js with App Router (use React components + API routes in `/app/api/`)
- **Data Storage**: Store tasks in memory (no database required)
- **Styling**: Any approach (CSS, Tailwind, styled-components, etc.)

### Leadership Component
Create a **README-SOLUTION.md** file that includes:
1. **Code Structure**: Explain how you organized your code and why
2. **Team Delegation**: If you were leading a team of 2-3 developers, how would you split this work? What would each person focus on?

## 🚀 Bonus Features (Optional)
- Delete task functionality
- Filter tasks by status (All / Done / Not Done)
- Edit task titles
- Task priority levels
- Simple animations/transitions
